# ESS ADK — One-Shot Installer

A single command that installs everything needed for the ESS Maker Kit: VS Code, Python 3.12, Git, GitHub CLI, Copilot extensions, pip dependencies, and clones the repo.

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap.ps1)
```

**macOS** (Terminal):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-mac.sh)"
```

Once complete, VS Code opens at `solutions/ess-maker-skills/` and `/setup` is automatically requested in Copilot Chat. You'll be prompted to trust the workspace and sign in to GitHub/Copilot — accept these prompts and `/setup` will run and connect your Dataverse environment.

> **GitHub Copilot subscription is required** for the in-editor maker experience. This script installs the toolchain and extension scaffolding; it does not grant the Copilot entitlement.

## Lite Mode (Chat-First Layout)

For users who prefer a simplified, chat-first experience that hides developer chrome (file tree, tabs, status bar) and shows a "Quick Actions" button rail:

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-lite.ps1)
```

**macOS** (Terminal):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-lite-mac.sh)"
```

This installs everything the standard installer does, plus the **ESS Maker Profile** extension which provides:
- A chat-only layout with all developer surfaces hidden
- Big-button "Quick Actions" rail for common tasks (Connect, Customize landing page, Post an announcement, Create, Scan, FlightCheck, Push)
- A built-in tutorial explaining each button

You can switch between lite mode and standard VS Code at any time using the toggle buttons in the Quick Actions panel.

## GitHub Codespaces (no local install)

> **Free tier available:** GitHub accounts include [120 core-hours/month of free Codespaces usage](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts) (60 hours on a 2-core machine). Compute is only billed while the Codespace is running — it stops automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity. For organizational accounts, your admin may need to enable Codespaces — see [managing Codespaces for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization).

For users who prefer a cloud-based development environment — no local toolchain or VS Code desktop install required. Just a browser and a GitHub account:

👉 [**Create Codespace**](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

The Codespace comes pre-configured with Python 3.12, pip dependencies, and GitHub Copilot. Select the **2-core** machine type (sufficient for the maker kit). Once it starts:

1. Open the `solutions/ess-maker-skills` folder (File → Open Folder → `/workspaces/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/solutions/ess-maker-skills`)
2. Run `/setup` in Copilot Chat to connect your Dataverse environment

### FlightCheck via Codespaces

The same Codespace environment can be used to run FlightCheck without the full maker kit setup. After creating the Codespace above:

1. Open the `solutions/ess-maker-skills` folder (File → Open Folder → `/workspaces/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/solutions/ess-maker-skills`)
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/flightcheck/cli.py --scope full --no-open
   ```
   `--no-open` skips the auto-launch of the HTML report (Codespaces can't open a local `file://` URL in your browser). Open the saved `workspace/flightcheck/report.html` manually from the file explorer instead.
3. Follow the prompts to sign in and select your environment

## FlightCheck-Only Mode

For users who want to run a pre-deployment readiness check on their Power Platform environment — no coding tools or VS Code required. Just run this command:

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-flightcheck.ps1)
```

**macOS** (Terminal):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-flightcheck-mac.sh)"
```

That's it. The script handles everything automatically:

1. Installs Python and Git (if not already present)
2. Opens a browser window for you to sign in with your Microsoft work account
3. Shows your available environments — pick one by number
4. Shows the agents in that environment — pick one (or skip)
5. Runs the full FlightCheck validation and displays results

### Changing your environment or agent

Re-run the same command — it will ask if you want to reconfigure:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-flightcheck.ps1)
```

### Running FlightCheck again (after initial setup)

Once you've run the installer once, you can re-run FlightCheck directly without going through setup again. The HTML report opens in your default browser when the run finishes — pass `--no-open` to skip (useful for CI / headless / SSH sessions).

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\source\Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit\solutions\ess-maker-skills
python scripts/flightcheck/cli.py --scope full
```

**macOS:**
```bash
cd ~/source/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/solutions/ess-maker-skills
../../.venv/bin/python scripts/flightcheck/cli.py --scope full
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Install-EssAdk.ps1` | Windows orchestrator. Installs toolchain via winget, pip dependencies, clones repo, installs extensions, launches VS Code. With `-FlightCheckOnly`, installs minimal toolchain and runs FlightCheck. |
| `install-ess-adk.sh` | macOS orchestrator. Same as above but uses Homebrew. Set `FLIGHTCHECK_ONLY=true` for FlightCheck-only mode. |
| `bootstrap.ps1` | Windows one-liner entry point (standard VS Code layout). |
| `bootstrap-lite.ps1` | Windows one-liner entry point (lite mode — chat-first layout). |
| `bootstrap-flightcheck.ps1` | Windows one-liner entry point (FlightCheck only). |
| `bootstrap-mac.sh` | macOS one-liner entry point (standard VS Code layout). |
| `bootstrap-lite-mac.sh` | macOS one-liner entry point (lite mode — chat-first layout). |
| `bootstrap-flightcheck-mac.sh` | macOS one-liner entry point (FlightCheck only). |
| `ess-adk-setup.winget.yaml` | Declarative DSC config consumed by `winget configure` (optional Windows path). |
| `telemetry/install-telemetry.ps1` | Installer telemetry emitter (PowerShell). Fail-open; emits install start/step/completion to Aria/1DS. |
| `telemetry/install-telemetry.sh` | Installer telemetry emitter (bash) — macOS/Linux mirror of the PowerShell emitter. |
| `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | Codespace configuration. Pre-installs Python 3.12, pip dependencies, and Copilot extensions. |

**Installer telemetry.** The installers emit pseudonymous setup-reliability
telemetry (install start / per-step / success-failure-cancelled completion, with
the installer variant, platform, failing step and a scrubbed error category)
natively from PowerShell/bash, because they run before Python exists. It is
fail-open — a telemetry issue never affects the install — and honors the unified
opt-out (`ESS_ADK_TELEMETRY=off`, or `python scripts/adk_telemetry.py off`). The
bootstraps download the emitter into their temp dir and pass its path via
`ESS_INSTALL_TELEMETRY_LIB`; if it can't be fetched, the install proceeds with
no-op stubs. See the ADK "Telemetry & Privacy" section for the full data model.

## Dependencies

The installer provisions the following dependencies. Users do not need to install these manually — the one-shot installer or Codespace handles everything.

## How to test it locally

### Windows

From this folder:

```powershell
# Run the full installer end-to-end:
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -InstallRoot $env:USERPROFILE\source-test
```

Useful flags during testing:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -SkipExtensions      # skip code --install-extension calls
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -SkipClone           # skip git clone (toolchain only)
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -SkipLaunch          # don't open VS Code at the end
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -FlightCheckOnly     # minimal install for FlightCheck only
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install-EssAdk.ps1 -SkipMakerProfile    # standard VS Code (no lite mode)
```

For air-gapped / locked-down environments, IT can mirror the files internally and serve them from an intranet URL by passing `-SourceBaseUrl`.

### macOS

From this folder:

```bash
# Full installer:
bash install-ess-adk.sh

# Full installer with lite mode (chat-first layout):
SKIP_MAKER_PROFILE=false bash install-ess-adk.sh

# FlightCheck only:
FLIGHTCHECK_ONLY=true bash install-ess-adk.sh

# Custom install location:
ESS_ADK_INSTALL_ROOT=~/projects bash install-ess-adk.sh

# Test against a branch:
ESS_ADK_BRANCH=my-feature bash install-ess-adk.sh
```

For air-gapped environments, set `ESS_ADK_SOURCE_URL` in the bootstrap scripts to point at your internal mirror.
