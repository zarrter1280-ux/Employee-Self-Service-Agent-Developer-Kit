# ESS Maker Kit

Customize your Employee Self-Service (ESS) agent using GitHub Copilot in VS Code — no deep platform knowledge required. Describe what you need in plain English and the kit generates topic YAML, workflow JSON, adaptive cards, and integration configurations for you.

> **This repo is intended as an example or learning tool.** It demonstrates how to customize Employee Self-Service (ESS) agents using GitHub Copilot in VS Code. It is not a Microsoft product or a supported service. See [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for the support model and [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for reporting security issues.

## Why This Kit

Building and customizing an ESS agent means working across topic YAML, Power Automate workflow schemas, ServiceNow/Workday connector patterns, adaptive card JSON, and Dataverse template configurations. The ESS Maker Kit packages all of that domain knowledge into a VS Code workspace so GitHub Copilot can do the heavy lifting — you describe the scenario, and the agent builds it.

---

## Features

### 🔌 Guided Dataverse MCP Setup

The kit walks you through connecting VS Code to your Power Platform environment via the Dataverse MCP server. Once connected, the agent can read your agent's components, create template configuration records, and push changes directly to Copilot Studio — all without leaving VS Code.

- Authenticates to your environment
- Discovers your deployed ESS agent and its components
- Creates a local working copy for safe editing
- Validates connectivity before proceeding

Run `/setup` and follow the prompts.

### 🎨 Customize the ESS Landing Page

Configure the active agent's tenant landing page directly from chat. Run
`/landing-page`, ask `Customize my landing page`, or use the **Customize landing
page** Quick Action.

- **Categorized starter prompts** help employees understand the agent's
  capabilities and guide them into common scenarios.
- **Accent colors** apply your light/dark brand colors to buttons, links, chat
  bubbles, and loading indicators.
- **Quick links** give employees direct access to important tenant resources.
- **Stay up to date** shows personalized, actionable cards for in-progress
  ticket status, required follow-ups, and time-sensitive tasks.
- **Quick Access** shows high-frequency personal information, such as time-off
  balances, paid holidays, and service anniversaries, at a glance.

The agent can apply exact changes directly or open rich editors for exploratory
updates. Landing-page configuration is saved through the production
AgentConfiguration service and does not use the local topic push pipeline.

Landing-page configuration requires the target agent to be published from
Copilot Studio and deployed to the organization. `/setup` installs and extracts
the Power Platform agent; publication, admin approval, and Integrated apps
deployment are separate steps.

### 📢 Post Organization Announcements

Publish announcements for the selected deployed ESS agent and its audiences. Run
`/org-announcements`, ask `Create an announcement`, or use the **Post an
announcement** Quick Action.

- **Standard announcements** carry a title, description, priority, and up to two
  actions.
- **Alerts** carry a single link action for time-sensitive notices.
- **Audiences** are security groups, mail-enabled security groups, or classic
  distribution groups, searched by name or email in one combined query.
- **Scheduling** publishes an announcement for a start/end window, and expired
  announcements can be published again through the normal editor after reviewing
  and updating their schedule.
- **Lifecycle** actions archive, unarchive, move back to draft, duplicate, or
  delete an announcement.

Describe the announcement in chat and the kit opens a pre-filled editor for you
to review — nothing is saved until you publish or save a draft in that editor.

Org Announcements are **scoped to the authenticated tenant and selected agent's
`titleId`**, not shared across agents. The current100 limit and latest50 archive
window apply per tenant-and-agent pair. There is no tenant-wide fallback.
The title is resolved using `list_agent_configs` and `search_agents` on the
`ess-org-announcements` provider. Discovery shares neutral Python code with the
landing-page provider, but does not require its MCP process or initialize its
configuration. Announcement authoring
requires the Org Announcements feature to be enabled for your tenant, and
audience search requires the `Directory.Read.All` Microsoft Graph permission to
be consented in your tenant.

Graph uses a separate resource token for the same authoring tenant and account.
The current account-context check requires readable `tid` and `oid` claims;
opaque tokens or credentials missing those claims return an explicit
authentication failure rather than using a different account. The API still
validates tokens and authorizes every request.

This development surface requires the matching agent-qualified v1.1 backend
and scoped widget. The MCP rejects unscoped canonical responses instead of
silently consuming records from an older backend.

### 📖 Pre-Loaded ESS Documentation, Samples & Best Practices

The kit ships with a complete reference library that the AI agent reads at task time — you don't need to look anything up yourself.

- **ESS documentation** — Overview, customization patterns, integration guides for ServiceNow (HRSD/ITSM), Workday (HCM/Payroll/Absence), and more
- **Official samples** — Real topic YAMLs, template config XMLs, and workflow JSON from the [CopilotStudioSamples](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotStudioSamples) repo, covering Workday employee/manager scenarios, ServiceNow HRSD/ITSM/Catalog, and Facilities
- **Best practices** — Evaluation strategies, conversational design patterns, responsible AI test sets, and the ESS template config + shared flow architecture
- **Integration-specific guidance** — Connector setup, SOAP/REST template patterns, and extensibility docs for each supported system

The agent uses this knowledge automatically when generating topics, workflows, or test sets.

### ✏️ Create, Update & Delete Topics

Create or update simple conversation topics from plain English, an approved
eval scenario, or existing evaluation files. The agent first creates an eval
contract, then writes the topic YAML and matching native evaluations.

- **Create** (`/create`) — Approve the intended evals, then generate a new
  simple informational, clarification, routing, or handoff topic
- **Update** (`/update`) — Approve updated and regression evals, then modify an
  existing simple topic and create or refresh its generated evals
- **Delete** (`/delete`) — Remove topics cleanly with dependency checking

Workday, ServiceNow, SAP, connector-backed, and flow-backed topics continue to
use the existing create and update behavior. Eval-driven integration support is
planned separately.

The agent handles the full pipeline: checkpoint → local edit → error scan → dry-run diff → push to Copilot Studio → verify.

### ⚡ Create, Update & Delete Workflows

Generate Power Automate cloud flows for integrations that don't have an ESS shared orchestrator (custom APIs, Jira, ADP, etc.).

- Generates `workflow.json` with proper trigger/action structure and Copilot Studio response bindings
- Creates connection reference entries for new connectors
- Wires the workflow into your topic's `InvokeFlowAction`

For ServiceNow and Workday, the kit uses the **template config + shared flow** pattern instead — no standalone workflows needed.

### 🔍 Error Scanning & Cleanup

Catch and fix compile errors before they reach production. The `/scan` command analyzes your entire agent for issues and walks you through fixes interactively.

- Detects broken variable references, missing workflow bindings, malformed YAML, and dependency conflicts
- Groups errors by severity and type
- Proposes fixes and applies them with your confirmation
- Re-scans after each fix to verify resolution

### 📊 Generate Evaluation Test Sets

Create structured CSV test sets that you upload to the Copilot Studio Evaluation portal. The agent reads your topics and generates tests across multiple quality dimensions.

- **Topic Triggering** — Verifies each topic fires on its trigger phrases plus paraphrased variants
- **Responsible AI** — Standard guardrail tests for harmful, adversarial, and policy-bypass prompts
- **Sensitive Topics** — Escalation scenarios for harassment, discrimination, and workplace safety
- **Emotional Intelligence** — Empathy and tone tests for emotionally charged requests
- **Ambiguous Prompts** — Verifies the agent clarifies vague requests instead of guessing
- **Integration Data** — Validates external system data retrieval with placeholder-based expected responses
- **General Knowledge** — Open-ended quality checks against loaded knowledge sources

Test sets are written to `workspace/tests/{date}/` in the exact CSV format Copilot Studio expects (`Prompt, Expected response, Test Method Type, Passing Score`). Run `/evaluate` to generate them.

### 🚀 Push to Copilot Studio

Every change follows the same safe deployment pipeline:

```
Checkpoint (backup) → Local edit → Error scan → Dry-run diff → Push → Verify
```

The `/push` command compares your local files against the last-known baseline, detects new/modified/deleted components, and syncs them to your Copilot Studio environment via the Dataverse API. Rollback is always one command away.

### ✈️ FlightCheck — Pre-Deployment Readiness Validation

Run a comprehensive readiness check against your live environment and all extracted agents before going to production. FlightCheck validates licensing, identity, infrastructure, integrations, agent configuration, and publishing readiness — then generates an HTML report you can share with stakeholders.

Run `/flightcheck` from Copilot Chat, or directly from the CLI (run from this solution's directory):

```bash
cd solutions/ess-maker-skills
python scripts/flightcheck/cli.py --scope full
```

**Standalone install (no VS Code or Copilot required):**

If you only need to run FlightCheck, this single command handles everything — installs dependencies, signs you in, lets you pick your environment, and runs the check:

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap-flightcheck.ps1)
```

Re-run the same command to change your environment or agent. See [`setup/README.md`](../../setup/README.md) for details.

**What it checks (41+ automated checks across 8 categories):**

| Category | What's validated |
|----------|------------------|
| Prerequisites | M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Teams licenses; Global Admin and PP Admin roles |
| Environment | Power Platform environment, Dataverse provisioning, DLP policies |
| Authentication | Entra ID configuration, Conditional Access policies, user sync |
| External Systems | Workday, ServiceNow, and SAP flow discovery and status |
| Workday Deep | Environment variables, connection references, flow status, 17 SOAP workflow tests |
| Agent Files | Agent instructions, starter prompts, required topics, variables, template configs |
| Configuration | Per-agent validation across all extracted agents (HR and IT) |
| Publishing | Golden prompts, UAT sign-off, managed solution export, admin approval |

**Key capabilities:**
- **Multi-agent** — automatically scans every agent under `workspace/agents/`, not just the active one
- **HTML report** — opens in your browser with color-coded results, priority highlighting, and clickable remediation links
- **Run history** — every run is archived in `workspace/flightcheck/history/` for trend tracking
- **Workday SOAP tests** — tests all 17 ESS workflows against the actual Workday API (reads credentials from `.vscode/mcp.json`, prompts for ISU password at runtime — never saved to disk)
- **Auto-fix offer** — after presenting results, the agent offers to fix issues it can handle (run `/connect`, `/scan`, enable flows) and re-runs the check
- **Graceful degradation** — runs whatever checks your permissions allow; skips the rest with clear messages

**Scopes** for targeted re-runs:

| Scope | What it checks |
|-------|----------------|
| `full` | Everything (default) |
| `workday` | Workday connections, flows, env vars, and SOAP workflow tests |
| `local` | Agent files only — no API calls |
| `prerequisites` | Licenses and roles only |

## Supported scenarios

This toolkit is designed for:

- **Authoring Copilot Studio topics** for ESS agents (Workday, ServiceNow HRSD/ITSM, custom integrations)
- **Generating Power Automate workflow JSON** for connector integrations that don't have an ESS shared orchestrator
- **Authoring template config records** for shared ESS orchestrators (Workday and ServiceNow)
- **Local validation** via `/flightcheck` and `/scan` before pushing to Copilot Studio
- **Working in a single Copilot Studio environment** (dev, test, or prod tenant of your choice)

## Unsupported scenarios

This toolkit does NOT:

- Replace Copilot Studio's own validation, evaluation, or runtime safety controls
- Provide hosted runtime, SLAs, or ongoing operations for the agents you build
- Manage cross-tenant or cross-environment promotion (no built-in CI/CD for Copilot Studio)
- Ship a production-ready packaged agent — you are authoring components in your own tenant
- Provide official Microsoft support beyond what is described in [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/blob/main/SUPPORT.md)

---

## Integrations

The ESS agent connects to external HR systems through Power Platform connectors and shared orchestrator flows. The kit automates the setup process — gathering credentials, configuring identity providers, creating service accounts, and installing extension packs — so you can go from zero to a working integration without reading platform docs.

### ServiceNow (HRSD / ITSM)

Connect your agent to ServiceNow for IT tickets, HR cases, and service catalog items. Run `/connect servicenow` to start.

**What the kit sets up:**
- **Entra ID app registration** for SSO — employees use their Microsoft work account to authenticate, with automatic token refresh
- **OAuth or Certificate auth** for service-to-service flows — configurable per environment
- **Power Platform connector** — the `shared_service-now` connector, pre-authorized against your Entra app
- **Extension pack installation** — installs the ServiceNow HRSD/ITSM extension in Copilot Studio with all connection references wired up

**Supported auth methods:**
| Method | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| Microsoft Entra ID (interactive) | Production — employees SSO through Microsoft |
| Certificate (service-to-service) | Non-interactive integrations |
| OAuth2 (ServiceNow credentials) | Separate ServiceNow login |
| Basic auth | Dev/test only |

**What you can build after connecting:**
- Look up or create ServiceNow incidents, HR cases, and catalog requests
- Query CMDB items, knowledge articles, and user records
- New scenarios use the **template config + shared flow** pattern — no standalone workflows needed

### Workday (HCM / Payroll / Absence)

Connect your agent to Workday for employee data, compensation, time off, and org lookups. Run `/connect workday` to start.

**Two supported install paths** — the kit detects which one applies and routes automatically:

- **Simplified** (Microsoft's default for new installs) — just one Workday connection (OAuthUser via Entra ID) plus Dataverse. No ISU service accounts, security groups, or custom reports. User context comes from the Workday REST `/workers/me` endpoint.
- **Legacy** — the older setup with ISU accounts, security groups, domain permissions, and the `WD_User_Context` RaaS report. Still fully supported for existing installs.

**What the kit sets up (simplified path):**
- **SSO via Entra ID** — verifies or creates the Entra enterprise app, configures trust with Workday, and pre-authorizes the Power Platform connector
- **Extension pack installation** — installs the Workday extension in Copilot Studio with the OAuthUser and Dataverse connection references configured (including the Workday REST base URL)

**What the kit additionally sets up on the legacy path:**
- **Integration System Users (ISUs)** — automatically creates `ISU_WQL_COPILOT` (for reports) and `ISU_GENERIC_COPILOT` (for API calls) via the Workday SOAP API
- **Security groups and domain permissions** — guides you through creating `ISSG_WQL_COPILOT` and `ISSG_GENERIC_COPILOT` with the correct domain policies
- **OAuth API client** — walks you through registering a SAML Bearer Grant client
- **WD_User_Context RaaS report** — verifies or guides creation of the custom report that maps Workday usernames to employee context data

**Supported auth methods:**
| Method | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| Microsoft Entra ID Integrated | Both paths — employees SSO through Microsoft, token exchange with Workday |
| Basic auth | Legacy path's ISU connections (`d6081`, `0786a`) |

**Verify-first approach:** The kit runs API checks against your Workday tenant before asking you to configure anything. On the legacy path, if ISU accounts, auth policies, permissions, or the RaaS report are already set up (common on shared tenants), those tasks are automatically skipped.

**What you can build after connecting:**
- Look up employee information, compensation, service anniversary, cost center
- Check time off balances and request time off
- Query emergency contacts, national IDs, passports, visas, certifications
- Update email and phone number
- New scenarios use the **template config + shared flow** pattern — no standalone workflows needed

### Workday MCP Server

The kit includes a local Workday MCP server (`src/mcp/workday/`) that enables direct Workday API access from VS Code during setup and development. It supports:

- **SOAP API** — Create integration systems, ISU accounts, and call any Workday web service
- **RaaS (Reports as a Service)** — Query custom reports like `WD_User_Context`
- **Worker data** — Get employee details, time off balances, org data
- **Connection testing** — Verify ISU authentication and permissions

The MCP server uses Basic auth with ISU credentials and is configured automatically during `/connect workday`.

### ServiceNow MCP Server

The kit also includes a local ServiceNow MCP server (`src/mcp/servicenow/`) for direct ServiceNow API access:

- **REST API** — Query and create records in any ServiceNow table
- **Connection testing** — Verify instance connectivity and credentials

Configured automatically during `/connect servicenow`.

### Quick Start

**Option A: One-shot Windows installer** (installs VS Code, Python, Git, and everything else):

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit/main/setup/bootstrap.ps1)
```

**Option B: GitHub Codespaces** (no local install — runs in your browser; [60 free hours/month](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing)):

👉 [**Create Codespace**](https://github.com/codespaces/new?repo=microsoft/Employee-Self-Service-Agent-Developer-Kit&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

Select the 2-core machine type. Once it starts, open `solutions/ess-maker-skills` (File → Open Folder) and run `/setup` in Copilot Chat.

**Option C: Manual setup** — clone the repo and open `solutions/ess-maker-skills` in VS Code yourself.

Then **run `/setup`** in GitHub Copilot Chat to configure your environment.

## Telemetry & Privacy

The ADK collects **pseudonymous** usage telemetry to help us understand which
capabilities are used and where they fail, so we can improve the product. It is
**enabled by default**; you can opt out at any time (see below).

**What is collected**

- A random **instance ID** (a GUID generated per installation) — used to count
  active installs and DAU/WAU/MAU. It is **not** tied to your identity.
- Your **tenant ID** (the Entra tenant GUID) — identifies the enterprise tenant,
  not an individual user.
- The **tenant display name** (organization display name for that tenant ID) —
  resolved best-effort via a Microsoft Graph lookup on the auth path. Tries
  `/organization` under `Organization.Read.All` (silent) first; if that isn't
  admin-consented, falls back to `/me?$select=companyName`, which reads the
  **signed-in user's Entra profile `companyName` attribute** (a user-profile
  field, not tenant metadata — enterprise admins routinely populate it with the
  tenant display name, so it is a useful label when the authoritative
  `/organization` call is blocked). This is org-level Organization Identifiable
  Information (OII), not a personal identifier. Left blank when neither call
  succeeds silently. See
  [Service dependencies](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#service-dependencies) for the
  Graph call details.
- A derived **tenant class** (`internal`, `customer`, or `unknown`) — a coarse,
  three-value flag computed from the tenant ID so we can report Microsoft-internal
  dogfood usage separately from external customer usage. It is non-identifying and
  lower sensitivity than the tenant ID it is derived from.
- Non-identifying context: ADK version, surface, session ID, event name, and
  per-event enums/metrics (e.g. FlightCheck verdicts, durations, check categories).
- Scrubbed, non-sensitive **error categories** when something fails.
- During **installation**, the one-shot installers (which run before Python is
  available) emit the same kind of event natively from PowerShell/bash: an
  install **start**, **per-step** progress, and a **completion**
  (`success` / `failure` / `cancelled`) carrying the installer variant
  (ADK or FlightCheck — the ADK-lite installer is not instrumented), platform,
  which step failed, and a scrubbed
  error category. This measures setup reliability. It is fail-open (a telemetry
  problem never breaks your install) and honors the same opt-out below.

**What is _not_ collected**

- No developer, user, or account identifier (no AAD OID, email, or name).
- No agent content, prompts, credentials, file contents, or personal data.

**How to opt out**

Run from the `solutions/ess-maker-skills` directory:

```bash
python scripts/adk_telemetry.py off      # disable telemetry
python scripts/adk_telemetry.py on       # re-enable telemetry
python scripts/adk_telemetry.py status   # show current setting
```

You can also set an environment variable, which takes precedence over the
config file. Syntax varies by shell:

```bash
# bash / zsh — one-shot inline, current session, or persistent in ~/.bashrc:
ESS_ADK_TELEMETRY=off python scripts/adk_telemetry.py status
export ESS_ADK_TELEMETRY=off
```

```powershell
# PowerShell — current session (add to $PROFILE to persist):
$env:ESS_ADK_TELEMETRY = "off"
```

```cmd
:: cmd.exe — current session; use `setx` to persist across new shells:
set ESS_ADK_TELEMETRY=off
```

**Storage, retention & deletion**

- Your preference is stored per-machine in `~/.adk/config`. Delete that file to
  reset to the default (enabled).
- Opting out stops all future collection immediately; it does not delete data
  already collected.
- Collected telemetry is retained for at most **30 days**.
- For full details and data-deletion requests, see
  [https://aka.ms/adk-telemetry](https://aka.ms/adk-telemetry).
