"""Typed Org Announcements draft and payload models.

Two families live here:

``SuggestedBulletinDraft``
    The *input* contract for a pre-hydrated create. It mirrors Vorpal's
    ``suggestedBulletinDraftSchema`` exactly and is deliberately narrower than
    the canonical record: it cannot carry a bulletin ID, a persisted lifecycle
    status, creator/modifier identity, audit timestamps, or any backend version
    or storage field. It carries both proposed content and editable copies,
    including actions that need repair. Opening that unpublished client state
    is never an authorization to write or proof of save/publish validity.

``AnnouncementEditorDraft`` and the ``open_org_announcements`` payloads
    The *output* contract consumed by the widget. ``build_create_draft``
    overlays a validated suggestion onto the editor defaults so an omitted
    field keeps the exact value the empty editor would have shown.

Field mapping between the two families is intentional and one-directional:
suggested ``priority`` becomes ``standardPriority`` and suggested
``secondaryAction`` becomes ``standardSecondaryAction``, matching the widget's
Standard-only editor fields.
