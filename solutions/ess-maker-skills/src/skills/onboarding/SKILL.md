# Onboarding Script

Every **Message** block is the exact text to show the user. Copy it verbatim.
Do not rephrase, add commentary, or tell the user what tools you are calling
or what files you are reading.

Follow `src/reference/ui-formatting-guidelines.md` for every user-facing
instruction in this flow. Resolve its examples with the actual environment,
agent, product, and connector names before displaying them.

---

## Start

Run `python scripts/setup_state.py show --view current`. When `connect_ready` is
true, this is workspace bootstrap after foundation setup:

1. Initialize `workspace/onboarding/steps.md` from the template only when it is
   missing.
2. Do not render another setup checklist or repeat foundation prerequisites.
3. Resume from the first unchecked workspace-bootstrap step.
4. Go directly to **Step 1 and Step 2** below.

Only use the legacy standalone onboarding messages below when foundation setup
is not complete.

Read `workspace/onboarding/steps.md`.

If the file does not exist, copy `src/skills/onboarding/steps.md` to
`workspace/onboarding/steps.md` and go to Fresh Start below.

If the file exists but mentions "Copilot Studio extension", "Clone agent", or
"PAC CLI", delete it, re-copy from `src/skills/onboarding/steps.md`, and show:

**Message:**

I noticed your setup checklist is from an older version. I've reset it to the
current flow. Let's start fresh.

**End message.**

Then go to Fresh Start.

If the file contains a `Readiness check` row, delete only that row. Preserve
the completion state of the four remaining onboarding steps. The legacy
optional FlightCheck is no longer part of `/setup`.

If the file exists and all items are checked, show:

Before showing the message, run this command without showing it to the user:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

If dependency installation fails, show the error and stop.

**Message:**

Setup is already complete! Run `/landing-page` to configure the branding and
content employees see, `/org-announcements` to post an announcement for your
selected deployed agent, or type `/menu` to see everything you can do.

**End message.**

Stop here.

If the file exists and some items are unchecked, find the first unchecked step
number. Show the checklist table (✅ for checked, ⬜ for unchecked) followed
by "Picking up at Step {N}." Then go to the matching step below.

### Fresh Start

**Message:**

| # | Step | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Dataverse configured | ⬜ |
| 2 | Agent discovered | ⬜ |
| 3 | Agent extracted | ⬜ |
| 4 | MCP server started | ⬜ |

Let's get your environment set up. These four steps take about 5 minutes.

**End message.**

Go to Step 1.

## Step 1 and Step 2

Read `src/skills/onboarding/step1.md` and follow it.

(Step 1 handles connecting to Dataverse. When it finishes, it tells you to
read step1b.md, which discovers agents. When that finishes, it tells you to
read step2.md, which extracts the agent and starts the MCP server.)

---

## Step 3 or Step 4

Read `src/skills/onboarding/step2.md` and follow it.
