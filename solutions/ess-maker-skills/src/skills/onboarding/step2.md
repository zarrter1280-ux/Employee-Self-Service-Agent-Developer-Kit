# Step 2: Extract, Configure, and Start MCP

Every **Message** block is the exact text to show the user. Copy it verbatim.
Do not rephrase, add commentary, or tell the user what tools you are calling.

You should already have these values from Step 1: ENV_URL, BOT_ID, BOT_NAME,
SCHEMA_NAME, IS_MANAGED.

---

## 2.1 — Fetch components and run setup

**Message (do NOT wait for user response — continue immediately):**

Extracting your agent — this usually takes 10–20 seconds...

**End message.**

Run this single command in the terminal (substitute all values):

```
python scripts/fetch_and_setup.py --url "{ENV_URL}" --bot-id "{BOT_ID}" --name "{BOT_NAME}" --schema "{SCHEMA_NAME}" {--managed if IS_MANAGED is true}
```

The script authenticates to Dataverse via the browser (the user will see an
account picker), fetches all components and template configs via the REST API,
and runs setup.py automatically. No MCP queries needed.

If the script fails with an auth error, tell the user to check they selected
the correct account with access to the environment, and re-run the command.

When the script completes successfully, update `workspace/onboarding/steps.md` —
change step 3 from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.

**Message:**

✅ Agent extracted.

{paste the script's summary output here}

One more step — we need to start the **Dataverse MCP** server so the kit can
work with your environment going forward.

**End message.**

## 2.2 — Start the Dataverse MCP server

**Message:**

Start the **Dataverse MCP** server:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Run `MCP: List Servers`.
3. Select `Dataverse`.
4. Choose `Start`.
5. Sign in with your Microsoft account when the browser opens.

Type `done` when `Dataverse` shows `Running`.

**End message.**

Wait for the user to respond.

## 2.3 — Finish

Update `workspace/onboarding/steps.md` — change step 4 from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.

**Message:**

✅ Core setup complete!

You can now customize your agent or connect an integration.

You can customize the active agent's landing page from chat, including accent
colors, categorized starter prompts, quick links, Stay up to date cards, and
Quick Access cards. Run `/landing-page` whenever you're ready.

You can also post announcements for the selected deployed ESS agent and its
chosen audiences. Run `/org-announcements` to create or manage them.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/landing-page` | Configure landing-page branding and content |
| `/org-announcements` | Create and manage announcements for the selected ESS agent |
| `/create` | Create a new topic or workflow |
| `/connect` | Set up ServiceNow or Workday integration |
| `/scan` | Scan for compile errors |
| `/flightcheck` | Run a pre-deployment readiness check when needed |
| `/menu` | See all commands |

**End message.**

Onboarding is complete. Return to
`src/skills/foundation-setup/SKILL.md` so it can show the completed handoff.
